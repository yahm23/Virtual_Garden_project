# Virtual Garden
using: Javascript, HTML, CSS, Vue, Node, Express, and MongoDB, and two APIs.

Group Project with three members.
This app was made by me and 2 others over a week. It uses two external npm packages that you can download following the set-up below. The single page app (that functions more as a dynamical site with some logic) allows a user to create a virtual garden; where they can choose an environment and be suggested plants to grow in that specific climate. From there they can get more details and choose to add it to their garden. A visual way of viewing the plants is then rendered as a mathematical fractal tree.

The front-end utilizes Vue, with the backend services using Express communicating to a MongoDB database.
